Hi, I’m @RamSoul
I’m interested in psychedelic visualizations :D 
I’m currently learning Python
I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning
programming is quite a fresh topic for me,
but I feel it's time to take care of it
Unfortunately I am still a slave to poor production work,
that's how i grew up and besides i live in a foreign region without a permanent internet connection,
:/ and robotics is science fiction for everyone i know. I plan to create interesting, captivating dimensions in a 3d environment. 
I have to show my relatives and everyone else the possibilities of creating real and beautiful things.
Apart from that, it will be useful for me to organize my few thousand photos :o
